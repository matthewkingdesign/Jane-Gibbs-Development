Text: This was a prophetic word I received in August 2019 which I won’t repeat in full here, but explains how the Holy spirit would meet God’s people in the secret place.  It symbolises the birthing and creating of something. It is the beginning of creation where God spoke into the space and created the cosmos.  I used a lot of movement to create this piece which is seen on the canvas.
