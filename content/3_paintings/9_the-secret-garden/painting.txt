I consider this to be a devotional painting as it is an expression of my heart toward God and the secret place I go to during my prayer times. My hope is that it is a restful piece. 
I used my hands initially to massage the paint onto the canvas.  I then used a large circular motion which gives movement to the piece.  A bit like dancing or spiraling into the scene. For the floral design I used different household objects to daub, smear and splat. To finish I used watered down paint to run down the canvas to symbolise the watering.
