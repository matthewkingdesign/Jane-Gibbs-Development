Title: The Roar

Heading: The Roar

Text: This is a prophetic piece symbolising God roaring over Britain in love and strength.  It started as a British flag on a dark background to which I added white and yellow to signify glory and the Holy Spirit.  This was painted using a palette knife and the colours are the seven spirits of God, sent out over our nation as the Lion of Judah roars.  It is also a declaration that God is roaring over us.
