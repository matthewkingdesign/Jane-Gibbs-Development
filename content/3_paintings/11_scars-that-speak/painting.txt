Text: This painting goes hand in hand with Bridal love as its opposite - passionate love.  I have called it scars that speak because to me it represents the scars inflicted onto Christâ€™s body as he was tortured and crucified.  This was one of my first paintings that I explored using mixed media (see also Bridal love).  I glued various materials (my favourite was frayed hessian) onto the canvas and then added dark intense colours to symbolise passionate brooding and suffering that love can sometimes bring.
