Text: This is a bold feminine piece using strong colours to depict passion, intimacy and feminine strength.  My inspiration was an amazing group of lady intercessors whose strength comes from their surrender and obedience to God, as well as their understanding of their identity in Godâ€™s kingdom. In this piece large circular movements were used with my hands and fingertips.  I also used pearl beads and sequins and love the texture and colours.
