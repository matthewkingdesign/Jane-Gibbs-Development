Text: I love the light in this one. The scene makes me think of summer walks where you can see a glimpse into the sunny meadow from behind the long grasses.  The long stalks were created by dragging my fingertips up the canvas to scratch out the darker paint.  It is called the meadow of promise to remind us that there are brighter days ahead even when we feel like we are wading through tall grasses.
