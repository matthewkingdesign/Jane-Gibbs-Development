Text: This is by far my favourite painting because of the journey and healing I experienced while I painted it.  It is called joyful song because it represents who I am inside.  While I was painting this piece, I felt to use reeds to hit the canvas and as I did so I felt God say this is what you do to yourself with the internal criticism and lack of self-love.  I then had a conversation about the pain endured during my childhood. I used different tools to hit the canvas and as I did so I felt anger and then peace released.  I then used a bandage to daub red and white paint over the canvas to signify my healing from God. The joyful song is what has replaced any pain I felt.
