Heading: Bridal Love

Text: This is one of my favourite pieces.  I love the pastel colours and  the femininity that is evident in this painting.  For me personally it represents the romantic love that the bride of Christ (the church) has for King Jesus, but it can also represent romantic love between two people. I added the sequins to give the bridal and royal feel to it.
