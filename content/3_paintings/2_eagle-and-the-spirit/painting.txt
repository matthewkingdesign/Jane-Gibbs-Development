This painting was built up in layers of colour starting with a delicate pink and transforming into a sky blue. I initially painted the eagle as a solid figure, but then used a feathery motion to give it movement. The eagle is a spiritual being bringing hope.  As a christian I believe it is the Holy Spirit of God coming to us.
