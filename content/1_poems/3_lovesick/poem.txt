Love Sick

I was heartsick before when you called me back.
Away from the liar and the noisy bustle of life.
You loved on me, as you restored and healed all broken, jagged parts of my soul.
Your fiery, intense love burned within me. Till the ashes revealed the beauty of you.
And now my identity is restored and I am whole.
I am His and He is mine.
This love exchange is real
Not just a God-man saving sinners,
But a lover king wooing a bride.

I was heartsick and now I am lovesick.

A true bridal romance, where I have stolen His heart and He has mine.
So much more perfect than we can imagine.
The ultimate love, so pure and divine.
I want to stay in this lovesick moment. To rest here and close the door.
The world has its delights, but can no way compare,
With this, this secret place.

This Space,

Where our love is exchanged.
Where I have ravished His heart too!
So that He rides over the mountains singing my name.
The intense burning in His heart for me.
A pure, jealous love that roars.
For every unsurrendered part of my heart,
For He is lovesick too!
