Text:

Sweet joy fills me up and I rest.
I laugh and smile for I am blessed.
He sings sweet music my heart to possess.
I sing sweet worship with all of my breath.
So, our duet is poetry, music, song.
For the bride and the bridegroom together belong.
He dies and she lives and victory is won.
Surrender a weapon and the death of a son.
A cross the symbol of love; sweet death is bliss.
And she is awoken by loves sweet kiss.
My eyes are now open and I see The King
Our passionate duet forever we sing.
