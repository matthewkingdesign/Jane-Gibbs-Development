Text:

A swirling, rising swell lifts my head.
My spirit-man is pulling me up to look upon the face of my Lord.
My King, my friend.
What can I offer? mere words to express?
Oh, the incredible joy at the knowledge of you.
Creator God, Infinite one, Papa.
I have come to bow before your throne.
My face looking for yours
My depths call to the depths of you.
Deep to deep, heart to heart, a true romance.
It is your Beauty and splendour that delights my heart.
And yet! And yet!
It’s my delight that conquers yours.
